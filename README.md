## Description:
This is a personal implementation of a Vector class in C++ that is similar to the Rust Vec class. The Vector class is a dynamically allocated array that can grow and shrink as needed. The Vector class is implemented using a template class so that it can store any type of data. Default capacity is 100 elements.
